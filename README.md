# Evoke - Game Engine

### Goals
- Good editor usability, focus on UX
- Easy to understand API design
- Multi-platform
- Modern rendering techniques, high visual fidelity
- Real-time raytracing

### Building
Currently Windows only, technically it should be possible to build on other platforms too, but the build process isn't entirely set up yet, and has therefore not been tested on other platforms.
- To generate solution, run `Build/WindowsGenerateProject.bat`
